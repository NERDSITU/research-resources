* Papers papers papers. Read the classics first, but also stay updated for example via arxiv or social media. Learn [how to read papers [pdf]](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs114/reading-keshav.pdf). Usually you do not want to read and understand everything in detail, but by the end of your PhD you should have an idea of the main findings and the context of at least a few 100 papers from first or second pass reading (and have done third pass readings of some dozen most relevant papers for your topic).
